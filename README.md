# Ping Pong Game by Pau Codina
This is a simple Ping Pong game created using Python's **tkinter** library.

 The game features a moving ball that bounces off the walls and a user-controlled platform on the left side of the screen. The objective is to keep the ball in play by moving the platform up and down.

## Requirements
**Python 3.x**


## How to Run the Game

- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

- Save the provided code into a file named ping_pong.py.

- Run the file using Python:

        python ping_pong.py



## Code Overview

### Importing the Library

    import tkinter as tk


The tkinter library is imported to create the graphical user interface for the game.

### Creating the Game Window

    root = tk.Tk()
    root.title("Ping Pong UPC")

    canvas_width, canvas_height = 800, 600
    canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=canvas_width, height=canvas_height, bg="black")
    canvas.pack()

A tkinter window (root) is created with a title **"Ping Pong UPC"**. A canvas is added to the window with dimensions 800x600 pixels and a black background.

### Ball Properties

    ball_radius = 20
    ball_color = "red"
    ball_pos = [canvas_width // 2, canvas_height // 2]
    ball_vel = [5, 5]  

The ball is defined with a radius of 20 pixels and red color. It starts at the center of the canvas and moves with a velocity of 5 pixels per frame in both x and y directions.

### Platform Properties

    platform_width = 20
    platform_height = 100
    platform_color = "blue"
    platform_x = 50  # Distance from the left wall
    platform_y = canvas_height // 2 - platform_height // 2
    platform_speed = 30

The platform is defined with a width of 20 pixels, height of 100 pixels, and blue color. It is positioned 50 pixels from the left wall and vertically centered. The platform moves at a speed of 30 pixels per frame.

### Creating the Ball and Platform

    ball = canvas.create_oval(ball_pos[0] - ball_radius, ball_pos[1] - ball_radius,
                          ball_pos[0] + ball_radius, ball_pos[1] + ball_radius,
                          fill=ball_color)

    platform = canvas.create_rectangle(platform_x, platform_y,
                                   platform_x + platform_width, platform_y + platform_height,
                                   fill=platform_color)

The ball and platform are drawn on the canvas using the defined properties.

### Ball Movement Function

    def move_ball():
    global ball_pos, ball_vel

    ball_pos[0] += ball_vel[0]
    ball_pos[1] += ball_vel[1]

    if ball_pos[0] <= ball_radius or ball_pos[0] >= canvas_width - ball_radius:
        ball_vel[0] = -ball_vel[0]
    if ball_pos[1] <= ball_radius or ball_pos[1] >= canvas_height - ball_radius:
        ball_vel[1] = -ball_vel[1]

    canvas.coords(ball, ball_pos[0] - ball_radius, ball_pos[1] - ball_radius,
                  ball_pos[0] + ball_radius, ball_pos[1] + ball_radius)

    root.after(30, move_ball)

The **move_ball** function updates the ball's position based on its velocity. It checks for collisions with the walls and reverses the ball's direction if a collision occurs. The ball's new position is updated on the canvas, and the function is called again after 30 milliseconds.

### Platform Movement Functions

    def move_platform_up(event):
    global platform_y
    if platform_y > 0:
        platform_y -= platform_speed
        canvas.coords(platform, platform_x, platform_y,
                      platform_x + platform_width, platform_y + platform_height)

    def move_platform_down(event):
    global platform_y
    if platform_y < canvas_height - platform_height:
        platform_y += platform_speed
        canvas.coords(platform, platform_x, platform_y,
                      platform_x + platform_width, platform_y + platform_height)

These functions move the platform up or down when the up or down arrow keys are pressed. The platform's position is updated on the canvas.

### Key Bindings

    root.bind("<Up>", move_platform_up)
    root.bind("<Down>", move_platform_down)

The up and down arrow keys are bound to the **move_platform_up** and **move_platform_down** functions, respectively.

### Starting the Game

    move_ball()
    root.mainloop()

The **move_ball** function is called to start the ball's movement, and **root.mainloop()** starts the Tkinter main loop to run the game.
